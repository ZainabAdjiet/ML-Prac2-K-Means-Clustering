# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

## How it works:
* Reads data points from file specified
* Counts initial setup of clusters with seeds as an iteration
* Writes clusters formed after each iteration to a file called 'output.txt', until clusters converge
* Also writes number of iterations it took to converge

## How to run:
1. Run 'make'
2. Run 'make run' to run:
    './kmeans_cluster data.txt'
